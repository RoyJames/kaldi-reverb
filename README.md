Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit (Modified)
================================

This repo is a modified version of Kaldi to use custom room impulse responses for testing artificial reverberation strategies.
The `master` branch is not very useful here. Please check out individual branches below for detailed usage instructions.

We assume you have moderate knowledge of how Kaldi works (i.e., building and debugging). For getting the normal version of Kaldi please visit the [original project site](http://kaldi-asr.org/).

### Speech corpus
No matter which recipe you use, you need to obtain the base data needed by that recipe legally. And we can not provide all datasets involved. Please read about individual benchmarks/challenges to learn what data you will need.

### Branches available

- ami
- reverb
